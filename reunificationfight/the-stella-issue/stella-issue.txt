OK, this one's serious.

All quoted lines without a username behind is Stella

Snapshot 1:
**KetchupKitty_ was killed by Stella**
What
me -> Stella: why
what was that
Epic_Oreo: ?
From Stella: "to show you who owns the valley, you're living in occupied territory and i can do whatever I want there"

Snapshot 2:
"i will kick you out of the valley if you don't obey our laws"
its you coming in first
i have respects for the valley
but if this continues
im leaving
"whose cat is this"
ketchups
"next time, it's the cat."
Epic_Oreo(basically the absolute genius): whats going on?
"I'm trying to show them who is in charge of the valley"
Epic_Oreo: ah, just move out of the valley if you have disagreements

Small Snapshot as Extra:
**KetchupKitty_ gets killed again**
"i'm building a castle here so either obey the laws or leave"
i thought wifi said he gave u all his money to be the bank last time i was on
"i'm his enforcer, i protect the rights of his territory"
i didnt know there was this stuff nobody told me
just joined server

So, that is all I got to show you. Ask me if you wanted actual screenshots(as i need to remove all personal information)
And then, as you can see, Stella is obviously just being a bully to new players. i do not know the reason.
But damage has been done, it has been done. I might not come back at all if this gets serious.
